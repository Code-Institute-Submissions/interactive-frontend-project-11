## Project Brief

In this project I was tasked with building an interactive front-end site presenting useful information to users, using all the technologies learnt so far in this course.

The data was to be presented in way that helps users achieve their goals and and advance the site owners goals.

Build a website for users to choose their next holiday destination (Travelverse) mainly using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and as on option jQuery or other jQuery libraries or external APIs. The project may be started using wireframes, as taught in the UX lesson.

Travelverse is a relatively new online business based in the Philippines opened 2 years ago. Currently only has three destinations to offer clients with three all inclusive packages. But is looking to expand in the future. The following requirements were given by the travel agency after meeting with the client;

 - Display information about the three cities that are potential holiday destinations.
 - Allow users to select/search a destination and see a map with relevant attractions, accommodations and restaurants. 
 - Present the results in a way that is visually pleasing and user friendly.
